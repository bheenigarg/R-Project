## Diagnosing breast cancer using KNN Algorithm (Lazy Learner)

The project utilizes the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic" dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). It includes measurements from digitized images of ne-needle aspirate of a breast mass. The values represent characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the digital image.

The breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies, each with 32 features. One feature is an identi cation number, another is the cancer diagnosis, and 30 are numeric-valued laboratory measurements. The diagnosis is coded as M to indicate malignant or B to indicate benign.

The 30 numeric measurements comprise the mean, standard error, and worst (that is, largest) value for 10 different characteristics of the digitized cell nuclei. These include:

* `Radius`
* `Texture`
* `Perimeter`
* `Area`
* `Smoothness`
* `Compactness`
* `Concavity`
* `Concave points`
* `Symmetry`
* `Fractal dimension`
