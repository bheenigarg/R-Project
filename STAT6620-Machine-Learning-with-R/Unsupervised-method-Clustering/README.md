## Finding teen market segments using k-means clustering

The goal here is to identify teenager groups that share a common interest such as sports, music, fashion, etc. using the text of Social Networking Services (SNS) pages. The clusters formed can be used to target specific segments for advertising.

For this analysis, a dataset representing a random sample of 30,000 U.S. high school students who had profiles on a well-known SNS in 2006 is used. The data include 30,000 teenagers with four variables indicating personal characteristics and 36 words indicating interests.
