## Predicting medical expenses using Linear Regression

The goal of the analysis is to estimate the average medical care expenses to enable insurance companies to set appropriate yearly premiums depending on the expected costs.

The dataset used is simulated containing medical expenses for patients in the United States. These data were created for [Machine Learning in R- Brett Lantz](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Second-Brett-Lantz/dp/1784393908) using demographic statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau, and thus approximately reflect real-world conditions.

The `insurance.csv` file includes 1,338 examples of beneficiaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating characteristics of the patient as well as the total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calendar year. The features are:

• `age`: This is an integer indicating the age of the primary beneficiary (excluding those above 64 years, since they are generally covered by the government).

• `sex`: This is the policy holder's gender, either male or female.

• `bmi`: This is the body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.

• `children`: This is an integer indicating the number of children / dependents covered by the insurance plan.

• `smoker`: This is yes or no depending on whether the insured regularly smokes tobacco.

• `region`: This is the beneficiary's place of residence in the U.S., divided into four geographic regions: northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest.

## Estimating the quality of wines with Regression Trees 

This analysis aims to estimate quality of wine on a scale of 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent) depending on numerous factors that contribute to the profitability of a winery. 

The data used for the study comes from [UCI Machine Learning Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
The white wine data includes information on 11 chemical properties of 4,898 wine samples. For each wine, a laboratory analysis measured characteristics such as the acidity, sugar content, chlorides, sulfur, alcohol, pH, and density.
