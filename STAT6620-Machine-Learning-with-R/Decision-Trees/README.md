## Identifying Risky Bank loans using Decision Trees

Uses dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Data Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)). 
They represent loans obtained from a credit agency in Germany.

The credit dataset includes 1,000 examples of loans, plus a combination of numeric and nominal features indicating characteristics of the loan and the loan applicant. A class variable indicates whether the loan went into default.

## Identifying poisonous mushrooms with Rule Learners (ZeroR, 1R, RIPPER)

To identify rules for distinguishing poisonous mushrooms, the Mushroom dataset donated by Jeff Schlimmer of Carnegie Mellon University to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom).

The dataset includes information on 8,124 mushroom samples from 23 species of gilled mushrooms listed in the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). The data dictionary available on the UCI website describes the 22 features of the mushroom samples, including characteristics such as cap shape, cap color, odor, gill size and color, stalk shape, and habitat.
