## Identifying frequently purchased groceries with association rules (Market basket Analysis)

Basket analysis is an alternative mode of learning recommendations. The acquired information can be used by grocery chains to devise promotional ads or discounts, optimize inventory or organize product layout in stores. 

In this case-study, I use the MBA to study transactional data from a grocery store. It will utilize purchase data from one month of operation at a real-world grocery store. The data contain 9,835 transactions, or about 327 transactions per day (roughly 30 transactions per hour in a 12 hour business day).
